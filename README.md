# logSays
Understand what the log is saying<br/><br/>

As a developer I might not know  
what is the best message to show in my log.  
logSays sets me free to focus on my code.  

Phase 1:  
We can start first by posting log messages and build a repo,  
of any log message we find which we don't understand.   
This will help us in understanding the patterns of where to take this project.<br/><br/>
tl:dr; Send PR

Long Version for people who are new to git/Github:  
-> Click on the fork button on the top right.   
-> After fork is done, click on Add File  
-> Enter the name of the software which is giving you this log message and  
append it with a / e.g. "React/".  
-> Then copy paste the log message in the filename and append .md in the end  
-> The file details can be like   
command: Command which you gave/ran/ or what did you do with the system  
logSays: What the log is telling you. 
itMeans: What do you think is happening or your research (this is optional)  
-> Then scroll to the bottom, add a message and save/commit.   
-> Come to your repo home and you will see an option to send a PR. Click it! :)  
  
Whenever someone finds what the log Says, please feel free to add it to the repository.
